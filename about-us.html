					<p class="para-fade">Our names are Veronica and Charlene and we are the designers and developers behind <em>They Are Your Classmates</em>.
					We are both Canadian-born Chinese who speak English as our primary language, so we never experienced any of the hardships that
					Chinese international students experience. However, we have observed throughout our lives that there is a stigma towards
					Chinese international students within our society and a tendency for Canadian students to have prejudices and misconceptions about them.
					Truthfully, in grade school we also had many of these prejudices and misconceptions, despite being Chinese ourselves.
					Our aim for this project was to understand why these misconceptions exist and connect to Chinese International students to understand their
					perspectives better and perhaps reconsider our own views and opinions on them.</p>

					<p class="para-fade"><em>They Are Your Classmates</em> was our way of connecting with these students that we largely ignored in school.
					Through our research and experience creating this project, we have learned and empathized with these studentsâ€™ stories;
					now we want to share them with you, in hopes that you will learn something too.</p>
