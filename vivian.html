					I hoped to make lots of friends in ESL classes but it was harder because I’m shy. A lot of them were here for a longer time and also spoke better English than me, which made me feel bad. I ate by myself at lunch for the first few months, but I have some friends now. We talk about anime and cosplay, which I love.</p>

Their English was so clean and their expressions were confident. The audience was engaged, laughing and smiling. When I spoke, everyone looked confused and awkward. The mood was completely different. I was so embarrassed.</p>

I needed any marks because I was close to failing, and I finally found the courage to raise my hand even though I’m terrified of speaking out loud. She kept choosing Canadian students to answer, and ignored the international students.</p>

				<li>I am so embarrassed about my accent and I always fear saying the wrong thing.</li>

			<h3>Your Perspective</h3>

				<li>They are usually too quiet during presentations and discussions and they should speak up.</li>
				<li>They’re annoying to work with because they never pull their weight. They contribute the minimum. I have to do most of the work.</li>
