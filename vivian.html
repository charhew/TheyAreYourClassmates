						I hoped to make lots of friends in ESL classes but it was harder because I'm shy. A lot of them were here for a longer time and also spoke better English than me, which made me feel bad. I ate by myself at lunch for the first few months, but I have some friends now. We talk about anime and cosplay, which I love.</p>

Their English was so clean and their expressions were confident. The audience was engaged, laughing and smiling. When I spoke, everyone looked confused and awkward. The mood was completely different. I was so embarrassed.</p>

I needed any marks because I was close to failing, and I finally found the courage to raise my hand even though I'm terrified of speaking out loud. She kept choosing Canadian students to answer, and ignored the international students. Why did the teacher make international students participate if she was only going to ask for Canadian students' answers?</p>

I have to translate every few words from the textbook into Chinese to help me understand, which takes hours. I'm sorry if I'm useless, but I promise I'm trying not to be.</p>
