				<p>I hoped to make lots of friends in ESL classes but it was harder because I’m shy. A lot of them were here for a longer time and also spoke better English than me, which made me feel bad. I ate by myself at lunch for the first few months, but I have some friends now. We talk about anime and cosplay, which I love.</p>

				<p>Even though I didn’t have a lot of friends in my ESL classes, I wish I could have stayed there. I dread my regular classes so much. I am silent during class because I think my accent is ugly and embarrassing.</p>

				<p>During English class we had a spoken word presentation. When my classmates stood at the podium and talked, they had stage presence. Their English was so clean and their expressions were confident. The audience was engaged, laughing and smiling. When I spoke, everyone looked confused and awkward. The mood was completely different. I was so embarrassed.</p>

				<p>A lot of the time I get confused on what homework we need to do or what the teacher just said, but I’m scared to ask my classmates because I don’t want them to think I’m annoying if I can’t understand them.</p>

				<p>Once, the teacher made us raise our hands and answer questions for a participation mark. I needed any marks because I was close to failing, and I finally found the courage to raise my hand even though I’m terrified of speaking out loud. She kept choosing Canadian students to answer, and ignored the international students.</p>
